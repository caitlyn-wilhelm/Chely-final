# Chely-final
Final Project for Team Chely

This dataset shows that there is currently a large amount of overweight and obese students in New York. There are sepecific counties and regions that have higher percentages than others. These percentages help show that this is a massive issue. The data can also help find a solution to this issue by focusing on the counties and regions that have a low amount of obese and overweight students and looking at what they do to have healthy students.
